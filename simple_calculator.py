# This program will calculate the two inputted numbers entered
# by the user using the basic mathematical operations.
# Appropriate exception capturing codes will be also implemented in this program.

# create a calculator function
    # create a while loop
	    # try asking the user to input two numerical values.
            # break the loop
	    # use except function to capture any Value Error
	# ask user for what operator to use
	# if response is '+', add two values
	# if response '-', subtract the first inputted number to the second inputted number
	# if response is 'x', multiply the first inputted number to the second inputted number
	# if response is '/' 
        # try dividing the first inputted number to the second inputted number
        # use except function to capture any Zero Division Error
        # break the loop
	# else, print Invalid Input

# To loop the program, create a while loop
	# call out the calculator function
	# ask user if they want to try again
		# if response is 'yes', continue
		# if response in 'no', break
		# else 
			# print 'Invalid Input'
			# ask user to try again	
# end program
